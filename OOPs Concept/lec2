C++ What are Classes and Objects?

Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.


Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and objects:

class                                        objects
Fruit                                        Apple

                                             Banana

                                             Mango


Another example:

class                                   objects
Car                                     Volvo

                                        Audi

                                        Toyota




So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and functions from the class.
